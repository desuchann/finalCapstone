# Bookstore.db
The final HyperionDev capstone project!

What does it do
---
This simulates what the backend of a program used by a bookstore clerk could look like. It can be used to 
- Enter a book
- Update a book
- Delete a book
- Look up a book
- View all books
- Restore the store to the last save point

Installation
---
Simply save the file locally and run it (probably F5) to get started! The in-memory sqlite database will automatically be created on your the first run.

Usage
---
Let's run through the expected outcome of each menu option.

Firstly, option 5 will tell you the current state of the database - we'll be using that often:

Next, let's remove a book with option 3:

Now let's edit a book that already exists:

Now we're familiar with what we have, let's look something up:

And now let's add another book to replace the one we deleted:

We were only playing around so let's restore the database back to rights:

Remember you can exit at any time:
